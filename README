RandomizedID
============

This plugin will give your models random generated primary keys in a simple and
clean way.  Now it only supports single primary keys that is named `id`.

Requirements and installation
=============================

It is based on ActiveRecord / ActiveModel and mainly aims to provide Rails
support so installing it as a plugin is the best way to install.  But you may
use it whereever your model provides #count() and #before_create() class
methods.

Example
=======

  class YourClass < ActiveRecord::Base
    include RandomizedID
    ...
  end
